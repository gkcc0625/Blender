As such it represents an alternative approach to hard surface texturing.\n\nIn addition DECALmachine has deep \nTrim Sheet\n support, and supports \nAtlasing\n, as well as \nBaking\n to facilitate \nexporting to game engines\n like Unity, Unreal Engine etc.\n\n\nDecals\n can be \nprojected\n, \nsliced\n, created from \ngrease pencil\n or \nedges\n. They can be \nmaterial matched\n, and you can \neasily create your own\n.\n\n\nTrims\n can be easily \nplaced\n, \ncut\n, \nmanipulated\n or \nremoved\n - all directly in the 3D view.\n\n\nRead on below for an \noverview\n of DECALmachine's tools and concepts.\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind\n\n\nThe focus of \nDECALmachine\n is speed and flexibility in terms of Design and Detailing. Depending on how far you intend to take your designs, and especially if you, intend to \nuse complex shader node setups or do complex texturing such as weathering\n, floating mesh decals might not be the best workflow, unless you are targeting a deferred rendering solution with mesh decal support, which allows for selective channel blending, instead of just alpha blending as in Blender's Eeevee and Cycles.\n\n\n\n\nSupport\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nIf you need to get in touch with me to \nreport an error\n, \nreport tool misbehavior\n or \nhave another problem\n \nREAD THIS FIRST\n.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nLearn \nwhat's new\n \nhere\n, or in the \nchangelog\n for a condensed version.\n\nFor \ninstallation\n help, see the \nInstallation\n page.\n\nHave \nquestions\n or \nproblems\n?

            "text": "2.6.4\n\n\nBlender 3.2 breaks material matching if Decals. This tiny bugfix releases resolves it.\n\n\n2.6.3\n\n\nYet another bugfix release, this time fixing a uber-rare issue where the addon perfererences or Decal update panel could become very sluggish.\n\nI've also added small, one-time thank you message, when opening the addon preferences forfthe first time.\n\n\n2.6.2\n\n\nBesides a few minor tweaks and adjusments 2.6.2 resolves a MacOS issue when registering Atlases caused by .DS_store files\n\n\n2.6.1\n\n\nThis is a hotfix release, dealing with an \nissue introduced\n in Blender 3.1 / Python 3.10.\nAtlasing and Decal-from-Text-Creation were affected by this, and will now work again.\n\n\n2.6.0\n\n\nThis is the Blender 3.1 release.  \n\n\nIn addition to 3.1 support, 2.6.0 also introduces the concept of \ncorrupted\n libraries in an effort to further harden asset registration and prevent user errors.\n\nDECALmachine always assumed that any folder in a decal or trim sheet library, contains a decal or trim decal accordingly.\n\nIf instead there are any other \nuser-placed\n folders, DECALmachine will now no longer register the library and will also not attempt to update it.\n\n\nAnd that's about it. Lately, I was rather occupied with \nPUNCHit\n and \nMACHIN3tools\n and even some \ndesign work\n for once.\n\n\nOh, I also have a \nPatreon\n account now, where I will do pre-releases of upcoming addons, and \nwhere I share blend files\n, if I manage to find time for art. So if you are interested in further supporting my work, that would be a good way to do it. It is very much appreciated! Thank you for considering!\n\n\n2.5.1\n\n\nThis is a bugfix release, that with one exception addresses only Blender 3.0 related issues, so it's completely optional for Blender 2.93 users.\n\n\nThe exception is what I'd call a visual bug in the Decal shaders for simple, subset and panel Decals. \n\n\n\n\nAO affects Roughness, but needs to be clamped\n\n\nThis issue has been present for a long time, but it's pretty minor and rarely noticeable, as evidenced by the fact that is hasn't been reported until now.\n\nAll supplied assets have been updated to clamp the AO/Roughness. Newly created User Decals will also no longer have this issue in this version.\n\n\nIf you want to fix existing Decals you've created yourself or got from a third-party, you can do this using the \nFix AO Clamping\n debug tool.\n\nNote, that I don't consider this a decal asset update per-se, and so there is no decal version change here. \nThe fix can be used in 2.93 and 3.0, and for each version, only the currently registered Decal Libraries will be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnable DECALmachine Debug mode, then find the Fix AO Clamping tool in the main Panel\n\n\n\n\nA complete list of all fixes can be seen in the \nchangelog\n.\n\n\n2.5\n\n\nThis is the Blender 3.0 release. Note, that at the time of this release, Blender 3.0 is still in beta.\nAlongside 3.0, Blender 2.93 LTS is still being supported, but support for any earlier versions is dropped now.\n\n\nThis release also no longer relies on Blender's \nbgl\n module for VIEW3D drawing.\n\nHowever, if you want DECALmachine to draw smooth, anti-aliased lines, you need to enable \nUse Legacy Line Smoothing\n in the addon \npreferences\n, which still uses \nbgl\n.\n\n\nAsset Update (Blender 3.0 only)\n\n\nBlender 3.0 introduces 2 new node inputs on the Principled BSDF shader node.\n\nAnd although I doubt many people will actually use them, an asset update is required to properly support these inputs for material matching.\n\nSince Blender 2.93 does not have these node inputs, the asset update will only be available in Blender 3.0.  \n\n\nAnd so understand, that DECALmachine 2.5 on Blender 3.0 will expect differently versioned Decals and Trim Sheets, than the same DECALmachine version run on Blender 2.93.\n\nAlso understand, that once you have updated your decals to the new version in Blender 3.0, you won't be able to use those same Decals in Blender 2.93 anymore.\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind\n\n\nThere is no downgrade tool, so make a backup of your existing decals, before you update them, if you want to keep them for later use in Blender 2.93.\n\n\n\n\nAs an unfortunate consequence of this, the supplied example assets provided by DECALmachine are not updated for Blender 3.0 yet, as otherwise they wouldn't work in Blender 2.93 anymore.\n\nSo if you install DECALmachine 2.5 on Blender 3.0, the first thing you will have to do is update all assets. This is conveniently done from the \naddon preferences\n.\n\n\n\n\nthe batch updater in the addon preferences\n\n\nBlend File Update\n\n\nIf you want to continue working on blend files created with previous DECALmachine/Blender versions, you need to update those blend files as well.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nBefore you update blend files, make sure you have updated the Decal and/or Trim Sheet libraries first!\n\n\n\n\nUpdating blend files is done from the \nUpdate Panel in the 3D view\n.\n\n\nThe \nValidate\n tool has been updated to identify the latest decal version - which is 2.5 in Blender 3.0.  If the tool encounters an incompatible version, it will now also point out the expected version, depending on the Blender version you use. \n\n\nUpdate Installation\n\n\nIf you are updating from a previous version of DECALmachine, I recommend doing the installation \nin the filebrowser\n, as it allows you to keep your existing addon preferences intact.\n\n\nAsset Registration\n\n\nDecal, Trim Sheet and Atlas registration continues to become more robust, and DECALmachine is now much more picky about what it does register and what it doesn't.\n\nThis is an attempt to avoid various user errors, and simplify debugging of related issues.\n\nTo help with any failed registration attempts, there is now more verbose output in the system console, as well as in the system info generated by the \nGetSupport\n tool.\n\nThere will also be warnings in the addon \npreferences\n accordingly(also seen \nabove\n).\n\n\nDecal and Trim Sheet Material Deduplication\n\n\nThis version improves deduplication of Decal and Trim Sheet materials. Dedplication always happens automatically in the background, and the improvements should lead to viewport performance improvements, especially in scenes with many Decal or Trim Sheet Materials - although I haven't done any testing in that regard.\n\n\nFurthermore, I've resolved an oversight, which caused no deduplication happening at all, when initiating Trim Sheet materials on objects without any existing material.\n\n\nMore\n\n\nThere's more, such as improvements in the \nRemoveOrphans\n tool, or improved MyDecal collision handling when changing the assets path to an external location, which is \nhighly recommended\n.\n\n\nDecals\n\n\nI've added a new 3rd party decal pack from \nUnis\n to the \ndecal resources\n section, featuring 100 unique fasteners, \ncheck it out\n!\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1\n\n\nA small bugfix release in response to Blender 2.93.4 breaking the TrimCut tool.\n\nThis release also addresses some some rare MacOS and Linux issues, that have come up.\n\n\n2.4.0\n\n\nThis release focuses mostly on improving the general workflow in DECALmachine and it tries to iron out various usability kinks.\nA lot of this in direct response to user suggestions, so thank you for providing feedback, and a big shoutout to \nfuncom\n.\n\n\nDecal Creation\n\n\nStarting off with \ndecal creation\n, you can now easily name info decals created from images, based on the source images' file names.\nWith a decal name taken from the source file, or when when using a custom name, you will now also have the option to skip the index.\n\n\nFurthermore, subset components on normal mapped decals can now be stored with a custom material - instead of the default metalic one - directly on the decal asset file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary Visibility + Presets\n\n\nDecal and Trim Sheet Library management has been improved by the introduction of visibility toggles accessed \ndirectly from the 3D view\n, as well as visibility presets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdjust Decal\n\n\nAdjust Decal\n has been tweaked to avoid undesired height changes, as well as to support cycling through a small subset of registered panel decals, instead of all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransferring UVs/Textures aka Texture Matching\n\n\nMatching textures has \nalways been possible\n, however I was hesitant to automate it because a decal parent's material can have arbitrary levels of complexity, and supporting every node tree setup under the sun is just not feasible and risks significant performance degradation.\n\nThat's also why I was encouraging for \n3rd party material addons\n to support DECALmachine, instead of the other way around. \nIt's easy for them as they are in control of their own complexity and all that's required there is plugging in their nodes into the decal group nodes.\n\n\n2.4 now supports texture matching a very specific node setup: UVed Image Textures directly connected to a Principled BSDF shader node.\n\n\nThis can be further automated in future, but for now it's done manually using the \nTransfer UVs\n tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\n\n\nLongtime DECALmachine user and contributer of the DECALmachine 1.8 promo image \nvarzov\n has released a massive city scape kitbash set, great stuff!\n\n\n\n\nTutorials\n\n\nAfter her excellent decal pack, \nCarol Sung\n is back with a fantastic tutorial covering HardOps, BoxCuttter, MESHmachine, DECALmachine and MACHIN3tools, check it out!\n\n\n\n\nMy God, it's full of Decals!\n\n\nThere have been quite a number of decal packs released since the DECALmachine 2.3 release!

See the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\nOf note is the addition of forced UUID support for advanced decal creation.\n\nWhile the majority of users will want to leave this option disabled, it can be used in pipelines, that build on DECALmachine's decal UUIDs and that require a lot of iteration.\nEnabled, forced UUIDs will ensure UUIDs are re-used, whenever a decal is re-created from source geometry, that was previously used for decal creation.\n\n\nNew Decal Packs\n\n\n2 new Decal Packs have been added to the \ndecal resources\n section, check them out:\n\n\nIhara Saikaku's Memento Aurora Heart Decals\n\n\n\n\nYigit Kilinc's Sleek Sci-Fi Decal Pack\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0\n\n\nBlender 2.92\n had its stable release this week, and so DECALmachine 2.2 \nshould be\n working fine with it based on some limited testing. If you come across any issues, please \nreport them\n.\n\n\nIf you are updating from a previous version of DECALmachine, please note the \ninstallation instructions\n in regards to updates.\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind\n\n\nBlender 2.9\n3\n is currently in very early alpha state.\n\nBeing the next LTS release, it will bring various deeper changes - incl. a new Python version - many of which are potentially addon-breaking and have broken DECALmachine 2.1 already.\n\nWhile 2.93 won't be officially supported until it nears its stable release, DECALmachine 2.2 does seem work with recent alpha builds. \nUntil it doesn't.\n.\n\n\n\n\nSweep Decal Backups\n\n\nJust like there's a \nSweep Stashes tool in MESHmachine\n, there's now \na similar tool\n for \ndecal backups\n in DECALmachine 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU Decal Creation\n\n\nIt's now possible to use the GPU when \ncreating decals\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecals Galore\n\n\nIt's amazing to see that DECALmachine users have been busy creating and sharing decals.\n\nCheck out these awesome new decal packs, and visit the \ndecal resources\n page for more.\n\n\nNick Burton's\n 50 Sci-Fi Decals\n\n\n\n\nMirko Sinjeri's\n 20 Sci-Fi Emission Decal Pack\n\n\n\n\nVinter's\n Connectors\n\n\n\n\nExorsis'\n Free Sci-Fi Decal Pack\n\n\n\n\nCarol Sung's\n 80+ Decals Pack + Demo 3D Model\n\n\n\n\nMark B Tomlinson's\n Latch Decals\n\n\n\n\nAnesthesis'\n Sci Fi Buttons/Switches\n\n\n\n\nTomas Krajcovic's\n Sci-Fi Emissive Decal Pack 2\n\n\n\n\nNika Zautashvili's\n DP03 / Nux Null\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nThere's been a bit more work on UI and future proofing, which you can see in the \nchangelog\n.\n\n\n2.1.0\n\n\nBlender 2.91 introduced the \nEmission Strength\n input on the Principled BSDF shader.\n\nDecal materials in DECALmachine build on this shader and expose most of it's inputs to the decal group's inputs.\n\nAnd so DECALmachine 2.1 introduces full support for \nEmission Strength\n, even going back to Blender 2.83 and 2.90, which don't provide that input on the Principled BSDF node.\n\n\nBatch Update Decal Libraries\n\n\nTo enable this, all decals you may have created in DECALmachine 2.0.x will need to be updated. You can still follow a process identical to the previous approach of updating Decals created in 1.8 - 1.9.4 for DECALmachine 2.0.\n\nOr you can use the \nnew BatchUpdate tool\n, which will update all Decal libraries - including Trim Sheet libraries - created in DECALmachine 1.8 - 2.0.1 in one go. \n\n\nWith the new BatchUpdate tool, and it's availability directly from the addon preferences, you can now also import legacy decals from the preferences, without the popup telling you that it can't be done.\n\nJust import any 1.8-2.0.1 library or libraries, and update it/them with a single button. Easy.\n\n\n\n\nNote, that I have removed the ability to update Decals created in DECALmachine 1.4.x/Blender 2.79. If you still have to do this, do it before you install DECALmachine 2.1.\n\n\nSet Trim UV Layer Index\n\n\nThere are also a few improvements, including the ability to choose in the addon preferences, what UV layer to use for Trims Sheets, as well as a workaround to prevent an annoying and as of yet unresolved Blender undo crash.  \n\n\nCheck out the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\nInstallation / Update from 2.0.x\n\n\nThis is how I'd suggest to install if you are updating from version 2.0.x.\n\n\n\n\nopen the addon preferences and find DECALmachine 2.0.x\n\n\nif your assets path is not pointing to an an external location(outside of Blender's addons folder), change that now\n\n\npick a different folder and all your assets will automatically be copied to your chosen location\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeactivate DECALmachine(don't remove just yet!), save your preferences, and restart Blender\n\n\nopen the addon preferences, remove DECALmachine 2.0.x and install DECALmachine 2.1 from the zip file\n\n\nchange your assets path to your external location\n\n\nif you had any custom Decals or Trim Sheets among your libraries, DECALmachine will detect it now and offer to update them all at once\n\n\n\n\nDecal Resources\n\n\nThe \ndecal resources\n page has been updated, and a new \ntrim sheet resources\n page was added.\nSupport decal/trim sheet creators and feel free to submit your own!\n\n\n2.0.1\n\n\nThe 2.0.0 release has proven to be extremly solid, and so more than a month after the release, only a handful of rare issues required tweaking or fixing.  \n\n\nCheck out the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\n2.0.0\n\n\nThis release has been in development for exactly one year. DECALmachine 1.9 released on \nSeptember 4th 2019\n, and I tweeted the first time about 2.0 on \nSeptember 11th\n.\n\n\nAnd so first and foremost, I want to thank everybody who was patient, supportive and encouraging along the way.\n\nI want to welcome and thank all the new DECALmachine users who bought DM over the past year too. You have financed this endeavor in large part.  \n\n\n3 people have been instrumental in the development of this release by testing and providing essential feedback:\n\n\n\n\nAleksandre Lortkipanidze\n\n\nThad Clevenger\n\n\nAlen Lapidis\n\n\n\n\nDECALmachine 2.0 would not be in the state it is in without them, so thank you guys!\n\n\nThanks also go to \nPonte Ryuurui\n and \nJosh Gambrell\n aka the \nBlender Bros\n, whose constant stream of educational videos definitely generated interest in my addons, in times when my output was limited to endless previews.\n\nThey have a \nnew free Decal Pack\n for DECALmachine 2.0 available right now!\n\n\nLast but not least, I want to thank the Blender developers, as their constant innovation, enabled some of the things in this release in the first place, specifically the fantastic gizmo system.\n\n\nSo what's actually new then?\n\n\nCode\n\n\nA lot\n is new. The amount of code has \ndoubled\n since 1.9.\nAnd that's because the two main features of version 2 - Atlasing and Trim Sheets - both go deep and are fairly complex. \n\nThankfully, the complete rewrite for 1.8 and so Blender 2.80, set me up perfectly for this. \n\n\nDocumentation\n\n\nComplex in code, but hopefully not complex for the user. I did my best to make these features as simple to use and as accessible as possible. And so with the update in code, also comes a major update in documentation. There are \n30 new videos\n - over 3 hours of new content.\n\n\nDecals\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, Decals themselves have also received an update and now support emission and transmission (and transparency).\n\nTo facilitate this, you need to \nupdate your Decals\n created in previous versions.\n\n\nExisting tools like \nDecal Creation\n, Match Material, Adjust etc. have been updated to support the new Decal materials.\n\n\nInstallation & Support\n\n\nPlease \ncheck out the \ninstallation instructions\n, especially if you have a previous version of DECALmachine installed!\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor this and the following videos, I highly recommend you check out the relevant pages in the docs, instead of just watching the videos, as the docs provide context and additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDECALmachine 2.0 is all about getting your Decals from Blender to Unity, Unreal Engine or any other game engine. \nIt's the export release\n.\n\nBaking was introduced in 1.9, but still has issues outside of my control. But baking Decals was never an optimal workflow anyway.\n\n\nHave a look at this \nExport Introduction\n for all of DECALmachine's export capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthis video was released early, so you may have seen it already\n\n\nAtlasing\n\n\nAtlasing\n allows you to pack individual Decals into a single Texture Sheet and then export that and the Decal objects to your engine of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrim Sheets\n\n\nTrim Sheets\n are similar to Atlases, but aren't only created for export purposes. Instead, they can be used in Blender/DECALmachine and open up a new detailing workflow, that can be used instead of (or in combination with) Decals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so Trim Sheets unlock a completely new \nsuite of tools\n in DECALmachine: the \nTrim UV tools\n.\n\nThese are UV tools, but can be used directly in the \n3D View\n!\n\n\n\n\nthe \nTrim Cut\n tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUV Tools\n\n\nIn addition to the Trim UV tools, there are also 3 more generic UV tools, which you may find useful outside of DECALmachine too.\n\n\nJoin and Split\n\n\nA favorite of mine is the addition of the Join and Split tools, which allow you to very easily, and non-destructively keep your scene organized, even with dozens or hundreds of Decals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nThere is more and I'd invite your to check out the \nchangelog\n for a comprehensive list of all changes and additions.  \n\n\nThe \nFixTexturePaths\n tool for instance has become quite a bit more powerful.\n\nSo please explore the documentation.\n\n\nAlso check out the \nnew Example Blend\n files!\n\n\n\n\nFinally, make sure you don't miss out on this \nfree emissive decal pack\n from the Blender Bros.\n\n\n\n\nAnd check out their DECALmachine 2.0 content on youtube too: \nRyuu\n, \nJosh\n.\n\n\nThanks again for your patience, and for reading this far, I appreciate it and leave you with the trailer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.9.4\n\n\nA major problem with how decals are saved Blender 2.83 has come to light.\n\nThis means all decals created in 2.83 are saved wrong, with absolute texture paths.\n\n\nAs a result, if you ever change the decal location, or move decals around to other libraries, or share them with other users, they will fail to display properly.\n\n1.9.4 introduces a work-around for the \nInsert\n and \nFixTexturePaths\n tools to deal with this problem.\n\nHighly recommended to install.\n\n\n1.9.3\n\n\nThis release ensures compatibility with Blender 2.83.\n\nSee the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\n1.9.2\n\n\nThis is a tiny bug fix release, preventing an error when creating info decals from monochrome images.\n\nIn addition there is a fix for recent 2.82 experimental builds, which broke the pie menu and the quick insert tool. Shoutout to Adrian from \nBoxCutter\n and \nHardOps\n fame for that!\n\n\n1.9.1\n\n\nThis build fixes various bugs, mostly minor, but some could crash Blender, especially 2.81. \n\nInfo Decal creation from JPGs has been removed. I had doubts when adding this anyway, and it turned out to cause problems for some users, so only PNGs are supported now.\n\n\nSee the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\n1.9\n\n\n1.9 represents the first major release after 1.8, which was released while Blender 2.80 was still in beta.\n\nThe intermediary 1.8.1 - 1.8.7 releases were either forced, due to breaking changes in the beta, or used to carefully roll out new tools and features to reduce the wait time for the full 1.9 release.\n\n\nNow Blender 2.80 is stable and DECALmachine has reached a major milestone bringing back the first part of the export pipeline: the baking of decals.\n\nIn addition there is a new Panel Cutting tool, as well as a tool to remove \nMESHCUT\n edges. There are new example files and the documentation has been updated to cover all changes and additions since the 1.8 release.\n\nThere are \n15 new videos\n explaining everything in detail!\n\n\nInstallation & Support\n\n\nHave a look at the updated \ninstallation\n instructions, they now also cover how to \nget support\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdating\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nI've added some advice about \nhow to update from previous versions\n, as there is a \nreal risk of loosing custom decals\n you may have created, if you don't do it properly.\n\n\n\n\nBaking\n\n\nBaking of Decals\n has been vastly simplified compared to how it was done in Blender 2.79 and DECALmachine 1.4.2.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBatch Info Decal Creation\n\n\nBatch Creation\n of Info Decals is now properly documented. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Panel Decals to Cut\n\n\nYou could always use Panel Decal's \nbackup\n cutter objects to cut into an object, either manually, or by using the \nMesh Cut\n tool in \nMACHIN3tools\n.\n\nBut with the introduction of the \nEPanel\n and \nGPanel\n tools, not all panel decals will have suitable backups, which is why there is now a dedicated \nPanel Cut\n tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPanel & EPanel\n\n\nWith 1.9, \nGPanel\n is now fully documented, and \nEPanel\n has received a number of updates!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\nCheck out the updates to the \nRe-Apply\n, \nMatch Material\n, \nSelect\n and \nInsert\n tools.\n\nHave a look at the changes to \npanels\n and the \ntexture storage\n option.\n\n\nAnd finally, try the \nInitialize Generated Coords\n tool, as well as the \nClear Decal Props\n and \nRemove Decal Orphans\n utils.\n\n\n1.8.7\n\n\nThis is a significant release and represents the latest state of DECALmachine. It is in essence the 1.9 release, but without the main feature of it - the Baking of Decals. I think it's best I finish documentation first, before this is released. I've also been working on \na new tool\n called \nPanel Cutting\n recently, for which you will also have to wait just a bit longer. \n\n\nEPanel\n\n\nHowever, there are various additions, that did make it into this 1.8.7 release. Such as \nEPanel\n, a tool similar to \nGPanel\n but instead of creating Panel Decals from Grease Pencil, it creates them from edge selections, or objects made of only edges.\n\nIn \nEdit Mesh\n mode, it is accessed from Blender's context menu(previously called the specials menu). With the 2.79 keymap, it's on the \nW\n key, whereas it's on the \nRMB\n with the new industry default keymap.\n\nIn \nObject\n mode, it is used like the \nSlice\n tool, where a target object is selected in addition to the \nedge-only\n object and called from the \npie menu\n.\n\n\nUI changes\n\n\nThe \ndebug panel\n has been removed, and the \nValidate\n and \nFix Texture Paths\n tools have been moved to the main DECALmachine panel.\n\n\nNew tools, that are useful at times, but aren't as commonly used like the ones in the pie menu have also been added to the main DECALmachine panel.\n\nThere is \nRemoveDecalOrphans\n, \nClearDecalProps\n as well as the \nInitGeneratedUVs\n tool. Refer to their tooltips for descriptions, until proper documentation arrives with the 1.9 release.\n\n\nDecal Creation\n\n\nBatch Decal Creation is now supported when creating \nInfo Decals\n from images. It's as simple as loading multiple images and ticking the \nAll source images at once\n checkbox.\n\nThe resulting instant decals will be laid out next to each other and can then be immediately added to a library using the \nAdd to Library\n tool - also all at once.\n\n\n\n\n with multiple images loaded, batch creation can be enabled\n\n\nDecal Creation now also works in local view. \nIn addition an issue with the \nFlatten Normals\n option, when used on meshes with existing custom normals has been fixed.\n\n\nOriginally, normal maps baked for Decal Creation, were also baked to 16bit floating point normals for this release, improving their quality. However, this has been postponed till 2.0 now to investigate an issue with supersampling/anti aliasing.\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nRe-Apply\n will now properly match the Material \nand\n Material 2 components of panel decal materials, when positioned accordingly across 2 supported materials.\n\nAn issue when reapplying already projected decals to match their materials has been fixed.\n\n\nThe \nMatch\n tool now has visual indicators to help you identify which side of a panel decal is the Material side and which one is the Material 2 side.\n\nIn addition to Blender's None/White Material, you can now also match DECALmachine's Default/Metal material - without it being present in the scene.\n\n\n\n\nPanel Decal Indicators of the \nMatch* tool\n\n\nWhen changing the type/material of a panel decal using the \nAdjust\n tool, previous material matches and manual changes, will now be maintained.\n\nThe cursor wrapping, when reaching the region boundary, has been improved as well.\n\n\nThe \nProject\n and \nSlice\n tool, will now properly clear custom normals, when projected/sliced on meshes that have them.  \n\n\nThe default behavior of \nsetting up surface snapping\n when bringing a decal into the scene, can now be disabled in the main DECALmachine panel.\n\n\nBlender recently introduced backface culling for Eevee materials. This is now enforced for decal materials, to avoid flipped decals going unnoticed.\n\n\nIf you use BoxCutter and want to access DECALmachine's pie menu while the BoxCutter tool is active, you can do that now - as long you you remap either BoxCutter's or DECALmachine's pie menu away from \nD\n, \nas described here\n here.\n\n\nCrash Fix\n\n\nLast but not least, there was a crash when using \nGPanel\n with the \nRedo Panel\n, which has now been fixed.\n\n\n1.8.5\n\n\nThis is a hotfix for Decal Creation. Height map creation and instant decal insertion from the panel were broken due to the recent depsgraph changes.\n\n\n1.8.4\n\n\nThis is a hotfix for the Slice tool, which as a result of the recent depsgraph changes, didn't clear the panel decal material slots properly anymore, which in some circumstances could lead to invisible panel decals.\n\n\n1.8.3\n\n\nThis is another unplanned release, but necessary due to depsgraph changes in Blender.\n\n\nRaycast behavior has been improved as well, and raycast performance was increased, which should be epecially noticable in bigger scenes.\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nThere are some issues with how decal normal maps are rendered right now, at the time of release, May 18th.\n\nThe issue is supposedly \nfixed already\n, but likely won't be available on build bot releases until May 19th.\n\n\n\n\n1.8.2\n\n\nThis is an unplanned release, but necessary because \nrB8f71a84496a9\n breaks \nMaterial Matching\n and with it the \nRe-Apply\n tool and Decal Insertion.\n\n\nTo fix the issue introduced in that commit, DECALmachine will just ignore the Alpha and Emission parameters of the Princibled PBR shader node for now. So, both of these are not \nmaterial matched\n.\n\nTo properly support those material inputs, all decal assets will need to be updated, which is much more involded and will be done for the 1.9 release.\n\n\nGPanel\n\n\nGPanel\n was supposed to go into 1.9 as well, but I've decided to release it early now - and without full documentation. It may need some more testing and work, so be warned.\n\n\nGpanel\n creates panel decals from grease pencil strokes.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use it, take the Grease Pencil and lay down strokes on the surface of a mesh object. The Line shape of the Grease pencil tool is very handy and I recommend you use that. Note however, that - for me at least - it has a tendency to crash Blender.\n\n\nLeave gaps between each stroke and be aware of the order and direction you draw the strokes in. Panel decals will be created based on that order.\n\nWhen done, you can use the Grease Pencil Sculpt tool with \nSHIFT\n pressed to smooth out the spaces.\n\n\nAfter that, go into object mode and choose GPanel from the DECALmachine pie menu. You can hold down \nSHIFT\n or \nCTRL\n to modiy is behavior.\n\nBy default no connections are made, but with \nSHIFT\n the gaps between strokes are closed. With \nCTRL\n you make the panel decal cyclic.\n\nYou can optionally also set these options in the \nRedo Panel\n. You can also set the segments for the connections there.\n\n\nGPanel always works on the active Grease Pencil layer and will hide a layer, once a panel decal is created from it.\n\n\nPIL\n\n\nFrom this version forward, DECALmachine will install PIL 6.0.0. If you have installed the previosu 5.4.1 already, no action is required on your part, 5.4.1 works just fine.\n\nIf you want, you can purge your existing PIL installation from the DECALmachine preferences and install the new one, but it's completely optional.\n\n\nThe installation process has been improved and will now remove any PIL found in the modules folder. There were a few people who attemted to install PIL like it was done in the 1.4 era: by moving a pre-compiled PIL into the modules folder.\n\nBesides being error prone, this will also interfere with how PIL is loaded now (from the user folder).\n\n\nFixes\n\n\nIn addtion to the material matching fix above, there has been a raycasting fix, where decals wouldn't align properly to modifier geometry.\n\nThis was due to a bug introduced in Blender a813e259d630 https://developer.blender.org/rBa813e259d630), shortly before the initial 1.8 release.\n\n\n1.8.1\n\n\nChanges\n\n\nThis update fixes a few issues that came up over the past 2 weeks.\n\nIt includes a workaround for an open Blender bug affecting the Unwrap tool.\n\n\nFurthermore it adds an optional, automatic update check, letting you know in the pie menu, if a new version is available.\n\n\nCheck out the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\nFAQ additions\n\n\nTwo new common questions have been added to the FAQ:\n\n\n\n\nWhy can't I access DECALmachine's pie menu when I activate BoxCutter's tool?\n\n\nWhy are my panel decal materials/textures taken from the Aircraft(or any other) library?\n\n\n\n\n1.8\n\n\nSimpler and more efficient, easier to use and more powerful.\n\nThis describes DECALmachine 1.8 in a single sentence, and I hope you will agree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.8 being a fresh start and completely rewritten, really should be be 2.0, but I'm holding that back, until I get to feature parity with 1.4.2.\nThat doesn't mean, that 1.8 is inferior. On the contrary: everything you need to work with Decals and to create Decals is here, and it's all far better, easier to use and more robust than before.\n\nCoupled with Blender's own advances like Eevee and Collections, DECALmachine 1.8 is a completely new experience.\n\n1.9 and 2.0 will bring back baking of decals to a texture, as well as exporting decals via atlas creation.  \n\n\nI've put considerable work into getting rid of a major pain point in the past: the installation of the infamous \nPIL module\n.\n\nBeta tests showed promise, that this is now solved for good, and for all 3 platforms, via an automated \ninstallation\n process, including two fallback installation methods.\n\n\nFor the times when help is needed, there is now a help panel and a \nRequest Support\n tool, streamlining the process and ensuring necessary information like log files is submitted with the first email.\nAlso, all feature videos in the documentation now have voice-overs.\n\n\nI want to thank everyone who has supported my work in the past. All of this is only possible through your contributions. Enjoy 2.80!  \n\n\nCheck out the \ntrailer\n, and \nfeature videos\n to get up to speed.\n\n\n1.4.2\n\n\nThis release fixes a number of issues, improves and refines many existing tools as well as adds 2 major new tools.\n\n\nReconstruct Panel Cutter\n\n\nThere's \nReconstruct Panel Cutter\n, which takes an all-quad panel decal and builds a cutter from it.\nUnlike the Extract Source tool, which brings back cutting objects used for Topo Slice and Float Slice, Reconstruct Panel Cutter also works for panels created via Draw Slice, for manually built panel decals or for panel decals joined from a number of other (simpler) panels.\nReconstruct Panel Cutter's resulting mesh will perfectly match your panel decal and can then be used for \nMaterial Cutting\n or \nMaterial Decaling\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurface Fix\n\n\nThere's also \nSurface Fix\n, which can be used to remove unwanted shading artifacts. This is achieved by maintaining a separate surface source mesh(similar to how \nWStep\n maintains a separate normal_src mesh) and transferring its normal information to vertices masked by a vertex group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\n\n\nThere's a few minor new tools such as \nEdit/Commit Normal Source\n and \nEdit/Commit Surface Fix\n, which can come in handy when working with WStep and Surface Fix. There's also an Unlink tool - for now only accessible via the space bar menu - which can quicky stash an object away without cluttering the scene, to be used as normal source meshes for either WStep or Surface fix.\n\n\nThe base material used by \nInit Base Material\n, is now customizable in the \nDECALmachine preferences\n.\n\n\nExtract Source\n, now has an option to remove the decal you are extracting the source from. This can save some clicks and avoids tricky selections.\n\nFurthermore, Extract Source now automatically unparents the extracted source.\n\n\nWstep\n has been extended and allows choosing the mapping method used in the DataTransfer mod. There's also a new option to allow hard edges, which creates a secondary DataTransfer mod and masks it using a vertex group.\n\n\nMaterial Cut\n has been improved to include a threshold value, used to merge duplicate vertices.\nBy default, Material Cut marks edges as seams. While this is great to separate out areas that are to receive different materials, it will also influence how UVs are laid out and force separate UV islands.\n\nTo circumvent this, you can now mark Material Cut edges as Freestyle edges. This is just to mark them, and make it easy to select them later.\n\nThere's two new tools called \"Convert Freestyle to Seam\" and \"Convert Seam to Freestyle\" accessed via the spacebar menu, to manually convert one into the other.\n\nAlso, the Unity, Unreal and Unpacked \nexport targets\n support treating Freestyle edges as material seams, without manually converting them. \n\n\nRotate Decal\n now has an axis option, which can be useful in some situations.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nMost of the \nsupplied info decal\n textures have been inverted to be white instead of black and so the invert slider in the info decal materials is now 0 by default.\n\n\nTextures for decals02-32 - decals02-37 have been replaced with higher quality versions.\n\n\nMACHIN3shaders(for the unity export) now include a \"Blend Surface Normals\" parameter, which mixes normals of the materials under the decals with the decal normals. This works perfectly for Info Decals. It's a hack for the other ones, but can produce good enough results.\n\nThe Transparency parameter in the info Decal shader has been renamed to Opacity.\n\n\nCurvature channels in the ao_curv_height maps of supplied panel decals has been improved or re-added. This was intionally removed initially to improve visual integration in Cycles. However it turns out it's really useful to have, if you want to bake it down to control weathering in Substance Painter or Unity.\n\n\nExport\n\n\nA 'Combine all-to-one' option has been added to the \nDECALBakeDown\n export target.\n\nIt overrides per-material-bake-combinations and instead combines bakes of all/selected export groups to one texture set.\n\n\nThe Unity, UE4 and Unpacked export targets have received a \"Assign Unique Materials\" export option.\n\nThis creates unique material IDs based on edge seams found on the model. This means you don't have to manually assign materials to areas they are supposed to receive unique materials before exporting.\nAssign Unique Materials is also available as a tool called form the spacebar menu. Run it on any mesh that has edges marked as seams.\n\n\nThere's a new 'Create DM_non-decals group' option in the DECALexport pie. This is for pure convenience and can be helpful managing your export groups, decals and non-decals when preparing for export.\n\n\nThe default atlas padding value used when packing a new decal atlas has been exposed and can be set in DECALmachine's \npreferences\n.\n\n\nFixes\n\n\nThere's been a number of fixes. See the \nchangelog\n for details.\n\n\n1.4.1\n\n\nPBR Decals\n\n\n1.4.1. started out as the second bugfix release for 1.4, but the 2.79 Blender release caught me by surprise and I was forced to implement some things originally intended for the 1.5 release.\n\n\nWhile Blender 2.78 is still supported, I'd generally advice anybody to switch to 2.79 now.\n\n\nWith the Principled BSDF shader being a central part of 2.79, DECALmachine needs to support Material Matching it and so needs to have PBR decals.\nTo achieve this the Match Material tool has been rebuilt from the ground up. It's extremely robust now and supports matching the Principled BSDF shader in addition to the Glossy shader.\nOperator properties have been added to modify its behavior and allow matching of either the Material part of a Subset Decal or the Subset part, or both at the same time. Similarly, both sides of a Panel Decal can be matched like this.\nFurthermore, if the target object carries multiple Materials, perhaps as a result of Material Cutting, each of the materials can be matched by stepping through the Material Slot parameter in the operator properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny new decals created in 1.4.1 via either Instant or Batch Decal Creation in Blender 2.79, will be switched to be PBR decals.\n\n\nInit Base Material\n will now also create a PBR base material, assuming it's run in Blender 2.79\n\n\nAs a consequence of improving the \nMatch Material\n tool, the old \nGet and Set Material\n tools could be completely removed, as they've become obsolete and redundant.\n\n\nUpdate Decal Nodes\n\n\nTo deal with scenes created before 2.79 and 1.4.1, there's a \nUpdate Decal Nodes\n tool, which you can call from the spacebar menu. This will update all existing decal materials in a scene to support PBR shaders.\nThis tool is also automatically run on new Decals being inserted into a scene from the Asset Loaders, as any Decals created before 1.4.1 naturally don't support the Principled BSDF shader and so need to be updated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges and Improvements\n\n\nFilmic was supported before, but was not native to Blender. Now it is and DECALmachine has added support for it.\n\n\nThe \nTopo Slice\n tool now has a twist offset parameter, which can be useful if a panel strip's boundary edge loops don't line up properly.\n\n\nPanel Transition has been improved and is much more robust now.\n\n\nThe triangulation method for DECALexport has been changed from BEAUTY to FIXED, which seems to resemble the viewport/opengl triangulation and so should avoid unwanted surface intersections after exporting.\n\n\nThe \nHOps Fix\n is now a part of HardOps itself making awkward code injections a thing of the past. As a result any Operatives should make sure to update to 'Hard Ops 0093 - Neptunium' before running DECALmachine 1.4.1.\n\n\nFixes\n\n\nAn export group related issue with decals projected on material decals has been fixed. Note that Material Decals should not be exported anyways, cut them into the mesh using Material Cut instead!\n\n\nThe \nRemove Decal Mode\n didn't properly clean the open scene of panel decal assets, this is fixed now.\n\n\nA number of people experienced problems with the \nRotate Decal\n option not working on the slice tools. This was related to them not having selection sync enabled in the UV editor, which now happens automatically.\nThis also caused the \nRotate Decal\n tool to not properly work, when run from edit mode.\n\n\nThe mesh.intersect tool in Blender has been changed in 2.79, which caused the \nMaterial Cut\n and \nPanel Transition\n tools to fail. Both are working great with the 1.4.1 update.\n\n\nDecal and CustomDecal asset paths will no longer resist changes to a custom locations.\n\n\nPreviously (W)Step would throw an exception, if it encountered empty material slots. A safety check has been added to prevent this.\n\n\n1.4\n\n\nComplete Decal Export Pipeline\n\n\nDECALmachine 1.4 is a huge release and the center piece of this update is the export capability.\nThis turns DM from a \nmere\n Blender addon, into a complete pipeline for mesh based decals: experiment, create, design in Blender, but then also get your work out into a number of target platforms, if you so choose.\n\n\nIn addition to the ability to export decals, there's also \n(W)Step\n - a tool/workflow to easily create custom vertex normals, which complement the decal workflow beautifully and are used to control hard surface shading without the need for normal maps. Note, it's highly recommended to use \n(W)Step\n along side HardOps and its boolean tools.\n\n\nIf you are taking your assets into Unity3D, DM even supplies shaders specifically made to be used with the DM exported decals - it's the whole nine yards.\n\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. The added ability to bake decal textures down into normal maps, ao maps, curvature maps, etc., unlocks a new approach to hard surface texturing, that could augment and in some scenarios perhaps even replace the traditional high-poly to low-poly workflow.\n\n\nSo, how does this all work? The first step in the export process is the creation of an optimally packed Decal Atlas from individual decal textures. This is in essence completely automated, but does allow for some user input, in that you have the ability to change the scale of individual decals in the atlas as well as adjust the padding between them.\n\n\nAlternatively, instead of creating a new Atlas pack for each new asset, you can also use an existing packing solution you've created previously.\n\n\nThe second step is organizing Decals and their parent objects(called \ntargets\n) via so called \nExport Groups\n. With this in place, decals will be joined, decal UVs will be adjusted according to the atlas packing solution and materials using the atlas textures will be applied - all automatically.\n\n\nFinally, your complete asset(incl. mesh decals) can be either exported to a number of platforms - such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4, Substance Painter and Sketchfab - or decals can be baked down, creating texture maps, that can be taken into any tool or engine you choose.\n\n\nExpanding the Slice Toolset\n\n\n1.4 introduces an alternative Slice tool called \nFloat Slice\n, useful in circumstances were the old \nDecal Slice\n - renamed to \nTopo Slice\n - has trouble or would fail, particularly on dense meshes.\n\n\nThere's also \nDraw Slice\n which is a precursor tool to \nFloat Slice\n and enables you to manually draw panel strips, by extruding vertices on the surface of an object.\n\n\nConcluding the additions to the slice tools is the \nPanelize\n tool, which makes adding simple decal strip shapes quick and effortless by turning polygon boundaries into panel strips, instead of the boolean-like approach of intersecting an object with a cutting object.\n\n\nImproving Usability\n\n\nOperator Properties\n\n\nThis release adds \nOperator Properties\n for the main tools. This makes using DM more interactive, simplifies dealing with unexpected behavior(such as \nTopo Slice\n failing) and allows for a greater degree of customizing each tools behavior. \nOperator Properties\n can be accessed from the bottom of the \nT\n panel  or by bringing up the \nF6\n menu.\n\n\nAutomatic Parenting of Projections and Slices\n\n\nIf you \nproject\n a decal or create a panel strip via one of the \nSlice\n tools, the decals will - by default - be parented to the object you project them on or the object you are slicing.\nThis extends to the \nDecal Sources\n as well. So, when you change your objects location, orientation or scale and attempt to bring back a \nDecal Source\n, it will be properly positioned, just where you'd expect it to be.\n\n\nKeymap Settings to Preferences\n\n\nChanging DM's keymaps is now extremely easy and can be done directly in DECALmachine's \npreferences\n.\nIn addition, all the GPencil tools can now be accessed via \nCTRL + D\n, so there's no longer any keymap overlap between DM and GPencil.\n\n\nScene Scale/Unit Settings support\n\n\nThere is a new setting called \nForce Consistent Scale\n in DM's preferences, which you should enable, if have experienced very small or big decals when dropping them into a scene in relation to your unit scale settings.\n\n\nRemove Decal Mode\n\n\nYou can now delete decals] from inside Blender, without having to navigate to the Decal Library locations on your hard disk.\n\n\nVarious Improvements\n\n\nMost tools have received small improvements and refinements in their behavior. Standing out from this is \nMaterial Cut\n which is now much more robust and has received \nOperator Properties\n to customize the behavior.\n\n\nWindows 32bit support\n\n\nWindows 32bit support through PILwin32.zip has been added thanks to Jordan.\n\n\nFixes\n\n\nDecal Project\n and through \nPanel Unwrap\n the \nSlice\n tools will now remove any pre-existing UVs before creating new ones to avoid potential issues.\n\n\nThe main DECALmachine pie menu is from now on keymaped only in \nObject\n and \nEdit\n modes instead of generally in all 3D Views, freeing the \nD\n shortcut for all other modes, such as \nSculpt\n and \nPaint\n modes.\n\n\nAn issue where non-tangent base normals would be created when running \nInstant Decal Creation\n has been fixed.\n\n\nAnother issue related to hidden geometry causing very dark AO maps has also been resolved.\n\n\nFurthermore, \nRemove Duplicates\n could in some cases replace custom decal materials with their supplied decals counter parts and was fixed.\n\n\nFinally, split panel decal strips causing \nPanel Transition\n to fail was rectified.\n\n\nHardOps and MACHIN3tools\n\n\nIf you use HardOps alongside DECALmachine, you should run the \nHardOps Fix\n in DECALmachine's preferences.md#general).\n\n\nFurthermore, I'd recommend you use at least some of the tools provided by \nMACHIN3tools\n, which is a free continuously evolving collection of scripts.\nIn particular, \nMirrror\n and \nShading Switch\n are particularly useful in combination with DECALmachine and highly suggest you use \nRed Mode\n, should you use DECALmachine's custom vertex normal tool \n(W)Step\n.\n\n\nMirror\n is the recommended way to mirror Decals across another object. If you are using Rob Fornof's \nMirror Mirror\n and/or my previous \nMulti Mirror Mirror\n, \nMirror\n replaces them both.",

While Blender 2.78 is still supported, I'd generally advice anybody to switch to 2.79 now.  With the Principled BSDF shader being a central part of 2.79, DECALmachine needs to support Material Matching it and so needs to have PBR decals.\nTo achieve this the Match Material tool has been rebuilt from the ground up. It's extremely robust now and supports matching the Principled BSDF shader in addition to the Glossy shader.\nOperator properties have been added to modify its behavior and allow matching of either the Material part of a Subset Decal or the Subset part, or both at the same time. Similarly, both sides of a Panel Decal can be matched like this.\nFurthermore, if the target object carries multiple Materials, perhaps as a result of Material Cutting, each of the materials can be matched by stepping through the Material Slot parameter in the operator properties.      Any new decals created in 1.4.1 via either Instant or Batch Decal Creation in Blender 2.79, will be switched to be PBR decals.  Init Base Material  will now also create a PBR base material, assuming it's run in Blender 2.79  As a consequence of improving the  Match Material  tool, the old  Get and Set Material  tools could be completely removed, as they've become obsolete and redundant.",

Panel Transition has been improved and is much more robust now.

In addition to the ability to export decals, there's also  (W)Step  - a tool/workflow to easily create custom vertex normals, which complement the decal workflow beautifully and are used to control hard surface shading without the need for normal maps. Note, it's highly recommended to use  (W)Step  along side HardOps and its boolean tools.  If you are taking your assets into Unity3D, DM even supplies shaders specifically made to be used with the DM exported decals - it's the whole nine yards.  But it doesn't stop there. The added ability to bake decal textures down into normal maps, ao maps, curvature maps, etc., unlocks a new approach to hard surface texturing, that could augment and in some scenarios perhaps even replace the traditional high-poly to low-poly workflow.  So, how does this all work? The first step in the export process is the creation of an optimally packed Decal Atlas from individual decal textures. This is in essence completely automated, but does allow for some user input, in that you have the ability to change the scale of individual decals in the atlas as well as adjust the padding between them.  Alternatively, instead of creating a new Atlas pack for each new asset, you can also use an existing packing solution you've created previously.  The second step is organizing Decals and their parent objects(called  targets ) via so called  Export Groups . With this in place, decals will be joined, decal UVs will be adjusted according to the atlas packing solution and materials using the atlas textures will be applied - all automatically.  Finally, your complete asset(incl. mesh decals) can be either exported to a number of platforms - such as Unity3D, Unreal Engine 4, Substance Painter and Sketchfab - or decals can be baked down, creating texture maps, that can be taken into any tool or engine you choose.",

Note the version requirement.\n\n\nWhat exactly is PIL/pillow and why is it needed?\n\n\nPIL is not required for basic DECALmachine usage, so for using and working with decals that are supplied with DECALmachine or for 3rd party decal packs, that support DECALmachine.\n\n\nIt is an image manipulation python module, used for decal creation and export, as well as for updating legacy decal assets (from previous versions of DECALmachine).\n\nThink of it as Photoshop for python or Photoshop by code.  \n\n\nInstallation is covered in the \nInstallation + Support video\n.\nFor more details on it, check out its own \ndocumentation\n.\n\n\nCan I install PIL/pillow without an internet connection?\n\n\nPIL installation is done only once.\n\nAn internet connection is needed, because Windows, MacOS and Linux all require a different set of installation files. To support all of these operating systems and guarantee PIL works properly, this online-installation process is the best choice and has proven to have a 100% success rate.\n\nIn the past I've supplied pre-compiled versions of PIL for all three operating systems, but they often failed to work properly due to various differences in OS installations. So now the necessary files are downloaded based on a users operating system, and PIL is then compiled on the users computer, thereby ensuring it will work properly.\n\n\nIf you have a second computer with web access and \nwith the same OS as your workstation\n, you can install DECALmachine and PIL on the second computer, then copy the PIL installation over to the one without web access, and with some luck, it will work fine.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the path of the PIL installation in \nBlender's console\n)\n\n\nWithout a second computer with internet access and using the same OS, you are out of luck and won't be able to create decals and trim sheets, or take advantage of atlasing and baking.\n\n\nUnless\n you want to \nbuild from source\n, at which point my support ends and you are on your own.\n\n\nWill DECALmachine work in Blender 3.0.0-alpha (some current experimental build)?\n\n\nUsing experimental builds of Blender, you are at risk of encountering sudden failures of addons that used to work just fine the day before.\n\n\nI can't make any guarantees if things will keep working. I can just try to fix things once they break. However, fixing things that break in experimental Blender builds will never be a priority, until the experimental build becomes stable.\n\n\nGet support\n\n\n\n\nAttention\n\n\nNote the \nRequirements\n in the installation guide.\n\nMake sure you are using the \nlatest version\n.\n\nConfirm you've followed the \ninstallation instructions\n.\n\n\n\n\nGeneral information\n\n\nTo provide help, I need the following:\n\n\n\n\nProof of Purchase\n\n\nsystem-info.txt\n and \npil.log\n \n\n\n\n\nPlease use the \nGet Support\n tool in the \nhelp panel\n or the about page of the \naddon preferences\n to create the system-info.txt and pil.log files, and for further instructions in the README.html file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErrors\n\n\nIf you are seeing an error, please send me a \nscreenshot of the system console\n.\n\nJust an screenshot of the error message popup usually lacks context and is not ideal.\n\nInstead of sending a screenshot, you can also \ncopy and paste\n the console text into the email.\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind\n\n\n\n\nOn Windows you can turn on the console from Windows > 'Toggle System Console'.\n\nOn Linux and MacOS, you need start Blender from a terminal.\n\nI \ndo not\n need an image of Blender's \nInfo View\n and I don't need to see Blender's \nPython Console\n either.\n\n\n\n\nIf the error only occurs on a certain model, please attach the blend file as well.\n\nPlease remove any part of the model that doesn't contribute to the problem to keep the file size down.\n\n\nTool misbehaviors\n\n\nIf you think a tool of DECALmachine doesn't do what it should do, please \nsend me the blend file\n.\n\nPlease remove any part of the model that doesn't contribute to the problem to keep the file size small.\n\n\nContact\n\n\nUse \neMail\n, not twitter, not youtube, not artstation, not blender market, and not the \nBlender Artists\n or \npolycount\n threads \nfor reporting of errors\n.\n\n\nOther Addons\n\n\nIs MACHIN3tools required?\n\n\nMASCHIN3tools\n is not needed, but I'd recommended to use at least some of its tools, as they are very convenient in the DECALmachine workflow.\nCheck out the \naddons\n section.\n\n\nAre HardOps and BoxCutter required?\n\n\nHardOps\n and \nBoxCutter\n are not needed to use DECALmachine. HOps/BC and DM fill different niches in a hard surface workflow.\n\nDM is a finishing and detailing tool. While HOps/BC are tools for working with form and generally improve the Blender experience greatly.\n\nAs such the addons complement each either very well and I'd recommend them to any DECALmachine user.\n\n\nFurthermore it should be noted, that the HardOps and BoxCuter developers have been and continue to be extremely supportive and helpful and DECALmachine would not be what it is, without their initial contributions and guidance.\n\n\nWhy can't I access DECALmachine's pie menu when I activate BoxCutter's tool?\n\n\nIf you make BoxCutter active, by pressing its button in the tool bar, or via the \nAlt + W\n shortcut, BoxCutter takes over and brings up its own pie menu when pressing the \nD\n key.\n\n\nTo avoid keymap conflicts and use DECCALmachine while the BoxCutter tool is active, you need to either remap the BoxCutter pie menu or the DECALmachine pie to a different key or key combination.\n\nFor instance, you could remap the BC pie to \nSHIFT + D\n. Once done, you can keep the BoxCutter tool active, access its own pie menu using \nSHIFT + D\n, as well as DECALmachine's with \nD\n.\n\n\nOtherwise, you will have to disable the BoxCutter tool(enable any other tool) every time to access DECALmachine's pie menu.\n\n\n\n\n the BoxCutter pie menu, remapped to \nSHIFT + D\n in the Keymap preferences\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\n\nHow do I snap decals to a surface?\n\n\nWhen Decals are imported using the asset loaders, by default all snap settings are prepared automatically - face snapping, align to surface, etc. Snapping itself is not turned on however.\n\nThe suggested method to move decals and align them is by holding down \nCTRL\n while  moving decals via \ng\n. This will turn on snapping temporarily for as long as \nCTRL\n is pressed.\n\n\nAs of \nversion 1.8.7\n the behavior to set up snapping - and thereby changing any existing snap setttings, is optional and can be disabled in the DECALmachine \npanel\n.\n\n\nHow do I mirror decals?\n\n\nDecals in DECALmachine - being objects - can be mirrored using Blender's mirror modifier, \nas described here\n.\n\n\nWhy are my panel decal materials/textures taken from the Aircraft(or any other) library?\n\n\nYou have enabled the \nPanel\n option for this other, non-panel decal library in the addon \npreferences\n.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the \nPanel\n property of a decal library, requires a library reload, or alternatively a Blender restart. Don't forget to save your preferences after the reload, or before the restart.\n\n\nTo change panel decal materials, check out the \nAdjust\n tool. Adjust will access all decal libraries marked as \nPanel\n.\nThe \nSlice\n/\nGpanel\n/\nEpanel\n tools will access that same pool of materials.\n\n\nWhy aren't there any Decal Libraries in the Pie Menu?\n\n\n\n\nno libraries, not even the supplied ones appear in the pie menu\n\n\nThis is default behavior when running DECALmachine 2.5 the first time in Blender 3.0.\n\nThe supplied example assets need to be (batch) updated for them to work in 3.0.\n\nSee \nthis what's new section\n for details on why and how.\n\n\nIf that's not it, verify you aren't using a \nlibrary visibility preset\n, that has all libraries hidden.\n\n\nMy Decal Libraries are LOCKED! What can I do?\n\n\n\n\nsupplied decal libraries are locked and can't be removed or written to\n\n\nYou are in \ndecal-remove-mode\n, and it's visibly enabled via the \"Removal\" button at the \nvery bottom\n of the pie menu.\n\nYou can not add decals to locked decal libraries, and you can't remove decals from them either.\n\nIf you find DECALmachine like this, right after starting Blender, you need to disable \ndecal-remove-mode\n and save your preferences.\n\n\nFor details on removing decals, check out \ndecal creation\n, specifically the very end.  \n\n\nIs there a way to make decals affect displacement instead of normals?\n\n\nTechnically it's trivial to change the decal node tree to do displacement as the height maps are already supplied. But think about it, a floating decal with actual displacement?\n\nFirst off, the decal would need to be subdivided a lot, which can be done, but secondly what would happen to the displaced geometry? It would intersect with the base mesh the decals are floating above - you wouldn't see much of the displaced geometry, as it is sunk into the base mesh.\n\n\nWhy doesn't the \nALT + LMB\n key combination for alternative modes in Project, Slice, etc. work?\n\n\nMake sure you haven't enabled \nEmulate 3 Button Mouse\n in Blender's Input preferences.\n\nThis option uses the \nALT\n key in combination with \nLMB\n to simulate a middle mouse button, which takes precedence.\n\n\nIf you want to keep this enabled, you can alternatively use \nALT + S\n to call the alternative mode in the \nSlice\n tool, or \nALT + D\n for \nProject\n, etc.\n\n\nMaterial Matching doesn't work properly! Why are the node inputs on the Principled BSDF shader node ignored?\n\n\nIt's working exactly \nas intended\n. Only plain pbr materials are supported.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAlso check out this \nrelated information\n as to why.\n\n\n\n\nThere is also \nthis\n and \nthis\n for matching \nsome\n textures.\n\n\nUnderstand that matching materials, with arbitrary node trees (any user could have a completely different node setup for his materials) is a significant challenge in regards to development effort, performance, and maintenance.\n\n\nAlso, from a purely practical perspective DECALmachine's main intended use cases are hard surface focused concept design and game art.\n\nFor neither of these do you need to match complex, textured materials - not in Blender anyway.\ndue to the magic of \ndeffered decal\n shaders\n\n\nThat said, matching decal to materials with more complex node trees in Blender, would be much easier to support from the developers creating material based addons, especially when those materials are procedural.\nFor instance, \nOliver J Post's instamat and smudgr addons\n do support matching decals.\nThat's because he knows exactly how his materials are structured, so he was able to build a tool to connect his node outputs to the decal node groups' inputs.\n\n\nDecal Creation\n\n\nHow do I create my own Decals?\n\n\nYou can ceate decals of all 4 types directly in Blender, see \nDecal Creation\n for details.\n\n\nHow do I create Decals from a whole folder of images?\n\n\nYou need to first load multiple source images. Once done, the \nBatch Creation: All source images at once\n option can be enabled.\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting instant decals will be layed out next to each other and can then be immediately added to a library using the \nAdd to Library\n tool - also all at once.\n\n\nCan I create Decals from \nAlphas\n?\n\n\nAlphas\n don\u2019t contain enough information to create decals from. They are just height information.\n\nDecals are normal, height, AO, curvature, mask and often subset mask. You could do without AO, curvature and height, but getting normals from height is flawed and creating the subset mask automatically is impossible.\n\n\nI\u2019d recommend adapting and modeling your favorite designs and create decals from that.\n\nAlternatively you could subdivide a plane \nA LOT\n and displace it using the \nAlpha\n, then create a decal from that subdivided, displaced plane. The results seem acceptable to \nsome people\n.\nThis process is prone to artefacting and does not produce subset masks however, so you are limited to \nSimple\n decals\n.\n\n\nCan I create Decals for damage and weathering effects, such as those from Quixel?\n\n\nThe focus of DECALmachine has always been hard surface detailing, either for concept, or game art with the aim of bringing decals into deferred rendering pipeline such as Unity HDRP or UE4.\n\n\nAs such (\nnormal mapped\n) decals in DECALmachine don't have color, roughness or metalness textures.\n\n\nIn Blender decal materials fetch these color, roughness and metallic properties from their parent objects through a process called \nmaterial matching\n.\n\nThe focus here is simple parameter based materials, not textured ones, and certainly not heavily weathered materials. Decals in Blender are opaque objects after all, and a generalized, automatic approach, that can match opaque decals to arbitrary user created node setups creating complex weathered materials is just not feasible and beyond the scope of what DECALmachine intends to do.\nIf decals had color, roughness, or metalness maps, then they couldn't be material matched, and they would stand out instead of visually integrate.\n\n\nFurthermore, in deferred rendering such as \nUnity HDRP or UE4\n, decal material properties for color, roughness and metalness are simply taken from the parent object's material - textured or not - simply through the nature of how decal shaders in deferred rendering work.\nAnd so again, textures for color, roughness and metalness are not needed.\n\n\nThis lack of support for color, roughness and metalness textures in normal mapped decals, makes using DECALmachine decals for damage and weathering effects impractical, until a new decal type is introduced specifically for this purpose.\n\n\nDecal Export\n\n\nCan I bake the Decal textures, to be used in a single texture set?\n\n\nYes, as of \nversion 1.9\n decal textures can be baked to their parent objects UV space. Checkout the \nBake tool\n for details.\n\n\nHow do you export Decals for use in Unity, Unreal Engine, etc.?\n\n\nIn addtion to baking, there are 2 more approaches to exporting in DECALmachine.\n\nLearn more them in the \nExport Introduction\n.",

I\u2019d recommend adapting and modeling your favorite designs and create decals from that. \nAlternatively you could subdivide a plane  A LOT  and displace it using the  Alpha , then create a decal from that subdivided, displaced plane. The results seem acceptable to  some people .\nThis process is prone to artefacting and does not produce subset masks however, so you are limited to  Simple  decals .",

As such ( normal mapped ) decals in DECALmachine don't have color, roughness or metalness textures.  In Blender decal materials fetch these color, roughness and metallic properties from their parent objects through a process called  material matching . \nThe focus here is simple parameter based materials, not textured ones, and certainly not heavily weathered materials. Decals in Blender are opaque objects after all, and a generalized, automatic approach, that can match opaque decals to arbitrary user created node setups creating complex weathered materials is just not feasible and beyond the scope of what DECALmachine intends to do.\nIf decals had color, roughness, or metalness maps, then they couldn't be material matched, and they would stand out instead of visually integrate.  Furthermore, in deferred rendering such as  Unity HDRP or UE4 , decal material properties for color, roughness and metalness are simply taken from the parent object's material - textured or not - simply through the nature of how decal shaders in deferred rendering work.\nAnd so again, textures for color, roughness and metalness are not needed.  This lack of support for color, roughness and metalness textures in normal mapped decals, makes using DECALmachine decals for damage and weathering effects impractical, until a new decal type is introduced specifically for this purpose.",

            "text": "Atlasing\n\n\nAtlasing\n in context of DECALmachine is the process of packing individual Decal textures into a single texture sheet, and then having all of those individual Decals, use a single material and set of textures.\n\nThis is necessary for efficient rendering in game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine etc.\n\n\nIn DECALmachine this is a 2 step process: \n\n\n\n\nAtlas Creation\n\n\nAtlas Use and Export\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAn \nAtlas\n in DECALmachine is defined by a set of textures, in combination with a \ndata.json\n file, containing meta data about the specific position of each decal in the atlas.\n\nAtlases and \nTrim Sheets\n share the same data format, hence why atlased Decals are also referred to as \nTrims\n in the data file.\n\n\n\n\nAtlas Creation\n\n\nDECALmachine 2.0 provides 2 Atlases ready to go.\n\nOne for the \nAircraft Decal\n library, and one for the \nExample and Example Panels\n libraries.\n\nSo, if you intend to export Decals from these libraries, you don't have to create your own Atlases, you can use the supplied ones.\n\n\nBut if you want to export your own decals, you have to create your own Atlas too. \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nYou can pack Decals from a variety of Decal libraries into a single Atlas. You don't have to create per-library Atlases!\n\n\n\n\nAtlas Creation is done from the \nDecal, Atlas & Trim Sheet Creation\n \npanel\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse and Export Atlas\n\n\nUse Atlas\n\n\nIn DECALmachine \nusing an Atlas\n means, changing a Decal's UVs to match the position of that Decal in the Atlas.\n\nIndividual Decals have UVs covering the entire UV space, but atlased Decals only cover a small part of it.\n\nWith the UVs changed, all Decals belonging to the same Atlas, will then also share a single \nAtlas Material\n.\n\n\nThis process of \nusing an Atlas\n is reversible, so you can restore your original Decals using unique textures at any time.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nSince Trim Sheets use the same data format as Atlases, Trim Decals can use those Sheets as Atlases right away. \n\nThere is no need to create new Atlases from Trim Decals, although you still can do that if you want.\n\n\n\n\nJoin and Split atlased Decals\n\n\nFor convenience DECALmachine also provides tools to Join and Split atlased Decals, because Decals that share a single Atlas Material, can be rendered more efficiently if they are a single object too.\n\n\nExport Atlas\n\n\nExporting an Atlas\n simply refers to the process of copying Atlas Textures to the desired target location.\n\nIf you want to channel pack the textures, you can do that directly from the Atlas section of the Decal Export \nPanel\n\n\nYou can optionally export your atlased Decals and any other selected objects from that same panel, or just use Blender's native object export.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnity\n\n\nUnity comes with two main \nrender pipelines\n: HDRP and URP.\n\nHDRP supports deferred rendering, while URP supports only forward rendering, and so no decal shaders.\n\n\nHDRP\n\n\nHDRP supplies it's own \ndecal shader\n, that you can try.\n\nBut most likely you'll you want to use a custom shader, for the Decals coming out of DECALmachine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeferred Decals will effortlessly blend with any material that's under them, even textured ones\n\n\nWith the advent of \nShader Graph\n, creating your own \nDecal Shader\n is easy and everyone can do it.\n\n\nA Decal shader can be very simple, and for instance only affect normals, or it can be slightly more elaborate - but still pretty simple:\n\n\n\n\na shader used for \nSimple/Subset/Panel\n Decals, affecting color, normals, AO, metalness, smoothness and emission\n\n\n\n\na shader used for \nInfo\n Decals, affecting, color, metalness, smoothness and emission\n\n\nYou can download the two shaders above from \nthis repo\n.\n\n\nAmplify Shader Editor\n\n\nYou can also use \nASE\n to build those exact same shaders.\n\nNot only does ASE provide a better experience, but you can also add parallax to you decals, that \nlooks exactly\n like the one used by DECALmachine in Blender.\n\n\n\n\nDecal \nparallax in ASE\n using a white height map\n\n\nURP\n\n\nIn URP's forward rendering, there's no way to reproduce the material blending you can have in HDRP. Decals will always be opaque, just like in Blender. \n\n\nAnd so if you use URP, I would suggest using \nTrim Sheets\n, over Decals.  \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nIn theory, you could still use Decals in URP using a simple Lit Shader, optionally alpha mapped.\n\nBut you'd be responsible for matching the Decal materials to the underlaying materials yourself.\n\nThis is possible with simple, plain materials, but not feasible with textured ones.\n\n\n\n\nUnreal Engine\n\n\nThis section about DECALmachine and Unreal Engine 4 is graciously provided by \nThad Clevenger\n, who was intrumental in the release of DECALmachine 2.0 and provided feedback throughout development.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nI would kindly ask you to \nnot contact\n Thad for support on this specifically and definitely not on DECALmachine in general.\n\nInstead, please submit any questions you may have and discuss this on \nBlender Artists\n or \npolycount\n.\n\n\n\n\nBackground\n\n\nI am a Senior Artist at Funcom working on our next big project, and I was tasked with helping determine the pipeline for our vehicles/hard surface objects.\n\nAfter doing a lot of research we ended up deciding to use the mid-poly/decal workflow, that I\u2019m sure most of you are familiar with. This is where DECALmachine comes in.  DECALmachine makes the process of creating, managing, and editing decals much easier.  \n\n\nNeedless to say, I wanted to add it into our pipeline. However, we were immediately faced with a big problem. UE4 does not have all of the functionality necessary to achieve the same visual results as DECALmachine in Blender or \nUnity\n.\n\nThankfully, with some searching and help from one of our programmers (Marcos Pereira) we were able to add that functionality to UE4 and get close to 1 to 1 parity with DECALmachine in UE4.  \n\n\nAs of now, Unity is still more powerful than UE4 when it comes to decals, but if your project is using Unreal and you want a decal solution then this is the best I have found.\n\n\n1. Patching Unreal Engine\n\n\nAs I mentioned above, at the time of this tutorial\nversion 4.24\n UE4 still doesn\u2019t have all of the decal functionality that Unity does.\n\nSpecifically, allowing you to edit the opacity channels of a decal independently. \n\nIn order to get parity with DECALmachine, you MUST have the ability to edit the opacity of a decal independently in its Diffuse, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal channels.   \n\n\nThe good news is that you can fix this with a small code update. The fix for this is \nfound here\n. You will need a Github account to access this link.  \n\n\nI\u2019m not a programmer so I\u2019m going to assume that you will have one of your programmers look at this link and add the code where necessary. \n\nHopefully Epic will update this themselves and then this step will no longer be necessary, but according to our programmers it is not hard to implement.\n\n\nWhat does the code change actually do?\n\n\nIt allows you to create a new type of opacity map that is basically 3 masks in one.  Depending on which channel the masks are in (R,G, or B) each channel affects a different part of your decal.\n\n\nA mask in the R channel of this map will ONLY affect the Diffuse and Emissive channels of your decal. \nA mask in the G channel of this map will ONLY affect the Normal channel of your decal.\nA mask in the B channel of this map will ONLY affect the Metal and Roughness channels of your decal.\n\n\nThe bit of code below shows what I stated above.\n\n\nOut.MRT[0].a = Opacity.r; // Emissive\nOut.MRT[1].a = Opacity.g; // Normal\nOut.MRT[2].a = Opacity.b; // Metallic, Specular, Roughness\nOut.MRT[3].a = Opacity.r; // BaseColor\n\n\n\nWhy is this functionality important?\n\n\n\n\nAs you see in the image above, the decal is displaying ONLY its normal in certain areas (i.e. surrounding the bolt) but it displays all of its channels (diffuse, metallic, roughness and normal) on the bolt itself.\n\nAllowing only the normal of the decal to show up in certain areas gives a really nice \u201cbuilt in look\u201d. Because of this, this bolt will always look like part of the background no matter what material I use behind it.\nCombined with Parallax Occlusion this is almost indistinguishable from real geometry.\n\n\nWithout the code change, a decal in UE4 shares transparency across all channels equally.  This prevents you from being able to achieve these nice transitions from the background object to the decal.\n\n\n2. DECALmachine\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThis section just walks you though the atlasing and export process.\n\nIt's also covered in more detail in video form \nabove\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you\u2019ve implemented the code above you can author your decals.\n\nYou can author them with any program, but I have found nothing that works better than DECALmachine and Blender out of the box. I\u2019m actually very new to Blender and still do most of my work in Maya. However, it is still worth it to bring my models into Blender just for DECALmachine alone. I can always bring them back into Maya when I\u2019m done and Blender is free so there is very little reason not to get it.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve placed a few decals on this cube asset to represent a final model. Once you've finished your own asset in DECALmachine and are happy with how everything looks then it is time to create an atlas.\n\nThis is a very powerful feature in DECALmachine so definitely take some time to go through the \nAtlasing section\n above.  \n\n\nTo create a new atlas from the decals you have placed you need to open up the DECALmachine sidebar in Blender by hitting the \nN\n hotkey. Then click on the MACHIN3 tab and go to the \nDecal, Atlas & Trim Sheet Creation\n section.  Click \nCreate new Decal Atlas from Scene\n, then re-pack/tweak as needed.\n\nOnce you\u2019re happy, you need to \nStore selected Atlas\n.\n\n\n\n\nNext, Select your Atlas in in the export \npanel\n, and have your decals \nUse the Atlas\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow we can export the textures we need to set up everything in UE4.\n\n\n\n\nYour export panel should look something like this\n\n\nMake sure you have \nmasks\n enabled in the \nChannel Packed\n section. \nThe four drop down menus should be set to the following:  \n\n\n\n\nSubset Occlusion\n\n\nAlpha\n\n\nSubset Occlusion\n\n\nNone\n\n\n\n\nThat is going to create our Opacity Mask that we talked about in \nStep 1\n,\nwhich is the most important texture in getting this all to look correct in Unreal.\n\nOnce your textures are exported, you will need to export your model as an fbx. Just select everything and export it as one object.  \n\n\n3. Finalizing Textures\n\n\nWe are almost ready to set everything up in UE4. Before we do that however, I like to finish my textures in Substance Painter so that I can customize my atlas\u2019 materials.\n\nAlso, UE4 does not currently\nv4.24\n support AO for mesh decals, so I like to fake them in the texture. Normally this is a bad idea, but in this case it\u2019s the only option. I\u2019ll explain how in the next step.\n\n\nFor this step I use Substance Painter, but you are free to do this however you like.\n\nIn Painter it\u2019s easy to add wear and dirt to my decals, etc.\nTo do this I bring the following maps, that I have just exported into Painter:\n\n\n\n\nCurvature\n\n\nAO \n\n\nNormal\n\n\nSubset\n\n\n\n\nThen I use these maps to generate my final atlas textures for UE4.\n\nI use the \nSubset\n texture as to mask where I want the materials of my decals to be - metal and paint in this instance. \n\nThe vent in the bottom right is solely in the normal map so it doesn\u2019t receive any materials.\n\n\n\n\nHere is what the cube looks like in Painter when I\u2019m done. Note, there is no parallax here, just a normal.\n\nI added a metal material to the left decals and painted the top right decal yellow. I also added some grunge to everything.  \n\n\nFaking AO\n\n\nSince UE4 doesn\u2019t have an AO channel for decals, make sure that \nANY PART OF THE DECAL ONLY SHOWING THE NORMAL MAP\n is made black in the color map.  \n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nDECALmachine itself, does not provide a color map for normal mapped Decals and so Atlases.  \n\n\n\n\nThis will really help make things look correct so I highly recommend doing it. It should look like the image below when done.\n\n\n\n\nuse the inverted subset mask to apply black color\n\n\nIf you do this correctly it will automatically work in UE4.\nThis is due to how we exported the \nmasks\n texture in \nStep 2\n.  It\u2019s complicated, but all you need to know is if your decal only has its normal map showing then it should be colored black for your diffuse / base color texture. \n\n\nAt this point you can export your final textures from Painter.\n\nAfter that, you should have a Base Color, Packed Roughness/Metallic, and a Normal Map.\n\n\nTake these textures along with the Height map and Opacity map you exported from DECALmachine, and import them all into UE4.\n\n\n4. Decal Shader in UE4\n\n\nNow that we have the final atlas textures created, we need to set up the decal shader in UE4.\n\nAnd of course we are going to using mesh decals for this workflow, not \ndecal actors\n.  \n\n\nThere are many reasons for this, but performance alone is worth it. The cons versus using a projected decal actor is, that you cannot move them around in engine. However, DECALmachine makes adjusting them easy and you just need to re-export the mesh again.\n\n\nFirst, create a material and call it whatever you like. This will be your decal material.\n\n\n\n\nIn the materials Details tab change the material domain, blend mode, and decal blend mode, to the properties above.\n\n\nNow it\u2019s just a matter of plugging in all of the maps we\u2019ve created into their correct locations. Plug in your Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal to their corresponding channels.  \n\n\nThe only new part of this process is the  \nmasks\n texture we exported in \nStep 2\n.\n\nMake sure you leave that texture set to \nsRGB\n in its properties and connect it to the Opacity channel as seen below.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see, that I have Parrallax Occlusion Mapping node connected to the UV inputs of my texture nodes, and I go into the settings for it below.  \n\n\nParallax Occlusion Mapping\n\n\nPlug the atlas height map at the top. I recommend you use the settings I have below for everything else.\n\nBut feel free to play around with it or use a Bump Offset Node instead.\n\nBump Offset doesn\u2019t look quite as good but is cheaper and still holds up for most cases.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nNow that we have all of our maps plugged in correctly, it should look like the image below.\n\nYou can use any material on the background cube object and the decals will look great due to the new opacity mask we generated.\n\n\n\n\nHere I swapped the cube\u2019s material to metal and the decals blend in perfectly due to the new opacity mask and code.\n\n\n\n\nThis was a very rudimentary example, but the pros for using decals for micro details combined with mid-poly models can be great.\n\nNo more texel density issues, lower texture memory, easy to edit, modular, faster to model, etc.\n\n\nI hope this helped you out.  I know it's fairly technical, but it is intended for devs that are looking for a decal solution with UE4.  Our goal is to help get UE4 working even better with DECALmachine in the future.\n\n\nCheers,\n\n\nThad Clevenger\n,\n\n\nSenior Artist at \nFuncom\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAgain, I want to reiterate to please not contact Thad for support.\n\nYou can submit any questions or suggestions you have \nBlender Artists\n or \npolycount\n.",

I\u2019m actually very new to Blender and still do most of my work in Maya. However, it is still worth it to bring my models into Blender just for DECALmachine alone. I can always bring them back into Maya when I\u2019m done and Blender is free so there is very little reason not to get it.   I\u2019ve placed a few decals on this cube asset to represent a final model. Once you've finished your own asset in DECALmachine and are happy with how everything looks then it is time to create an atlas. \nThis is a very powerful feature in DECALmachine so definitely take some time to go through the  Atlasing section  above.    To create a new atlas from the decals you have placed you need to open up the DECALmachine sidebar in Blender by hitting the  N  hotkey. Then click on the MACHIN3 tab and go to the  Decal, Atlas & Trim Sheet Creation  section.  Click  Create new Decal Atlas from Scene , then re-pack/tweak as needed. \nOnce you\u2019re happy, you need to  Store selected Atlas .   Next, Select your Atlas in in the export  panel , and have your decals  Use the Atlas .   Now we can export the textures we need to set up everything in UE4.   Your export panel should look something like this  Make sure you have  masks  enabled in the  Channel Packed  section. \nThe four drop down menus should be set to the following:     Subset Occlusion  Alpha  Subset Occlusion  None   That is going to create our Opacity Mask that we talked about in  Step 1 ,\nwhich is the most important texture in getting this all to look correct in Unreal. \nOnce your textures are exported, you will need to export your model as an fbx. Just select everything and export it as one object.",

Before we do that however, I like to finish my textures in Substance Painter so that I can customize my atlas\u2019 materials. \nAlso, UE4 does not currently v4.24  support AO for mesh decals, so I like to fake them in the texture. Normally this is a bad idea, but in this case it\u2019s the only option. I\u2019ll explain how in the next step.  For this step I use Substance Painter, but you are free to do this however you like. \nIn Painter it\u2019s easy to add wear and dirt to my decals, etc.\nTo do this I bring the following maps, that I have just exported into Painter:   Curvature  AO   Normal  Subset   Then I use these maps to generate my final atlas textures for UE4. \nI use the  Subset  texture as to mask where I want the materials of my decals to be - metal and paint in this instance.  \nThe vent in the bottom right is solely in the normal map so it doesn\u2019t receive any materials.   Here is what the cube looks like in Painter when I\u2019m done. Note, there is no parallax here, just a normal. \nI added a metal material to the left decals and painted the top right decal yellow.

Note  DECALmachine itself, does not provide a color map for normal mapped Decals and so Atlases.     This will really help make things look correct so I highly recommend doing it. It should look like the image below when done.   use the inverted subset mask to apply black color  If you do this correctly it will automatically work in UE4.\nThis is due to how we exported the  masks  texture in  Step 2 .  It\u2019s complicated, but all you need to know is if your decal only has its normal map showing then it should be colored black for your diffuse / base color texture.   At this point you can export your final textures from Painter. \nAfter that, you should have a Base Color, Packed Roughness/Metallic, and a Normal Map.  Take these textures along with the Height map and Opacity map you exported from DECALmachine, and import them all into UE4.",

There are many reasons for this, but performance alone is worth it. The cons versus using a projected decal actor is, that you cannot move them around in engine. However, DECALmachine makes adjusting them easy and you just need to re-export the mesh again.  First, create a material and call it whatever you like. This will be your decal material.   In the materials Details tab change the material domain, blend mode, and decal blend mode, to the properties above.  Now it\u2019s just a matter of plugging in all of the maps we\u2019ve created into their correct locations. Plug in your Base Color, Metallic, Roughness, and Normal to their corresponding channels.    The only new part of this process is the   masks  texture we exported in  Step 2 . \nMake sure you leave that texture set to  sRGB  in its properties and connect it to the Opacity channel as seen below.

Here I swapped the cube\u2019s material to metal and the decals blend in perfectly due to the new opacity mask and code.   This was a very rudimentary example, but the pros for using decals for micro details combined with mid-poly models can be great. \nNo more texel density issues, lower texture memory, easy to edit, modular, faster to model, etc.  I hope this helped you out.  I know it's fairly technical, but it is intended for devs that are looking for a decal solution with UE4.  Our goal is to help get UE4 working even better with DECALmachine in the future.
