## Requirements

* Windows, MacOS or Linux
* Blender 2.93 (LTS), Blender 3.1 (stable)


!!! danger "Experimental Builds"
    [Experimental](https://builder.blender.org/download/daily/) Blender builds such as 3.2-alpha are **not supported**, and fixing any issues related to them, will not be a priority, but [reporting them](faq.md#get-support) is still encouraged.  

!!! danger "Custom Builds"
    Custom Blender builds such as *OctaneRender for Blender* may not support all of Blender's native shader nodes.  
    DECALmachine only relies on native Blender nodes and is not at fault for any issues resulting from using custom builds.


### Blender on MacOS

MacOS users should install Blender properly, by following the [official instructions](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/getting_started/installing/macos.html).  
Avoid running it just from the Downloads folder!  
Note that, for **dragging** of files and folders, you need to hold down the `COMMAND` key.  
This will ensure [AppTranslocation](img/installation/apptranslocation.jpg)[^1] is avoided. 

[^1]: Learn more about [AppTranslocation](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/app-translocation.html).


### Blender on Arch Linux

Arch Linux users and users of other Arch based or similar rolling release distros are advised to use the [official Blender builds](https://blender.org/download).  
The Blender package in the [Community repository](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/blender/) does not supply its own Python, and does not follow [official recommendations](https://docs.blender.org/api/current/info_tips_and_tricks.html#bundled-python-extensions).  
As a consequence, the system's python version may not work with DECALmachine.


### Latest DECALmachine

The latest version of DECALmachine is 2.6.3 - available on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/DECALmachine) and [Blender Market](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/DECALmachine).  
See [this page](whatsnew.md) to learn what's new in the latest versions, or see the [changelog](changelog.md) for the full, detailed release history.


### PIL/Pillow

For more advanced usage of DECALmachine, a python module called [PIL/Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is required.  
PIL enables DECALmachine to manipulate images, and so is required for [Decal](decal_creation_instant.md) and [Trim Sheet](trim_sheet_creation.md) Creation, as well as for [Atlasing](export_atlas.md) and [Baking](export_bake.md).  
Installation has been automated and is covered below. Some additional information can be found the [FAQs](faq.md#what-exactly-is-pilpillow-and-why-is-it-needed). 

!!! warning "Keep in mind"
    If you use DECALmachine 2.6.3 in Blender 3.0+, you will need PIL to [update the supplied example assets](whatsnew.md#asset-update-blender-30-only).
    

## Updating

### Decal Backup

!!! danger "Attention"
    If you are updating from a previous version, you are at **risk of loosing** any [Decals](decal_creation_instant.md), [Atlases](export_atlas.md#atlas_creation), [Trim Sheets](trim_sheet_creation.md#trim-sheet-creation) you may have created or any [Bakes](export_bake.md) you may have done.  

If you have not chosen a decal assets location outside the DECALmachine folder in [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder), you should backup your decals as described in the video, and outlined below.


### Uninstallation

As a result of this [Blender/Python issue](https://developer.blender.org/T77837), you need to uninstall your old version of DECALmachine first, before installing a new one.  
You can find two approaches to do this in the Installation video, and outlined below.

!!! warning "Keep in mind"
    This is especially important for feature updates, such as from version from 2.5 to 2.6.
    <!--For bug fix updates, such as from version 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, *uninstallation can be skipped*, but installation in Blender from the zip **on top of the already installed version 2.6.0 will still not work**.  -->
    <!--Instead you should close Blender, extract the DECALmachine_2.6.1.zip file, and copy the extracted DECALmachine folder to Blender's [addon directory](blenders-addons-folder), replacing the existing files. -->

*this video covers **installation**, decal backup, PIL, external assets path, **support** and more*

---

The same instructions as in the video, but in text form:


### 1. Fresh Installation
> NO previous version of DECALmachine installed

* start Blender, bring up preferences
* switch to the *Add-ons* tab and click the **Install...** button at the top right 
* locate the downloaded DECALmachine_2.6.2.zip file and double-click it
* activate the addon by ticking the checkbox
* ensure your preferences are saved (by default done automatically)
* optionally, switch to the Decal Creation + Export tab, and install PIL
* close preferences and in the 3D View press the `D` key to bring up the DECALmachine pie menu


### 2. Update Installation
> previous version of DECALmachine installed already

#### 2a. Update Installation in Blender

* start Blender, bring up preferences
* switch to the *Add-ons* tab and use the search input at the top right to find your currently installed DECALmachine version
* unfold DECALmachine and shift click on the folder icon of the assets path
* in your filebrowser copy your old decals to a safe location
* back in Blender, deactivate your currently installed DECALmachine version
    - DO NOT click on the Remove button just yet
* ensure your preferences are saved (by default done automatically)
* quit and restart Blender
* back in the DECALmachine addon preferences, with DM now deactivated, click the Remove button
* with DM uninstalled, click the **Install...** button at the top right 
* locate the downloaded DECALmachine_2.6.2.zip file and double-click it
* activate the addon by ticking the checkbox
* ensure your preferences are saved (by default done automatically)
* optionally, switch to the Decal Creation + Export tab, and install PIL
* close preferences and in the 3D View press the `D` key to bring up the DECALmachine pie menu


#### 2b. Update Installation in the File Browser

!!! danger "Attention"
    **Never** install DECALmachine in Blender's program folder.  
    On Windows, that would be `C:\Program Files\...`
    DECALmachine needs write access to its installation folder, so you need to install it into [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder).

* with Blender closed, navigate to [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder)
* find DECALmachine, and copy the DECALmachine/assets/Decals folder to a safe location to backup your existing decals
* remove the DECALmachine folder
* in your Downloads location, extract the DECALmachine_2.6.2.zip file
* copy the DECALmachine folder from the zip file to [Blender's addons folder](#blenders-addons-folder)
    - note, if you have a DECALmachine_2.6.2 folder after extraction, don't copy this one, instead copy the DECALmachine folder contained in it
* start Blender and check if the pie menu (`D` key) comes up
* optionally, switch to the Decal Creation tab, and install PIL if it isn't already


## Blender's Addons Folder

!!! note "Addons Folder (in user scripts location)"
    **Linux**: `/home/name/.config/blender/3.1/scripts/addons`  
    **MacOS**: `/Users/name/Library/Application Support/Blender/3.1/scripts/addons`  
    **Windows**: `C:\Users\name\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\Blender\3.1\scripts\addons`  

    <!--Depending on your Blender version, replace `3.1` accordingly.-->
