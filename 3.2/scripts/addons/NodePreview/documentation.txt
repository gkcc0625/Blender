NodePreview Documentation
-------------------------

This addon displays rendered thumbnails above Cycles shader nodes.

https://blendermarket.com/products/node-preview

# Requirements

* OS: Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04/19.10/20.04, or macOS (Catalina or newer)
* Blender version: 2.80, 2.81, 2.82, 2.83, 2.90, 2.91, 2.92, 2.93, 3.0

# Features

* For each node, a preview thumbnail is rendered
* On edits, all affected nodes are automatically updated
* Previews are rendered in a background process to keep the Blender interface fluid and responsive
* No changes are made to the .blend, others without the addon can still open your scenes without problems
* High-resolution displays supported (works with Blender's resolution scale feature)

# Caveats

* Only Cycles nodes are supported. Previews are not generated for special Eevee nodes like "Shader to RGB", or for nodes from other render engines.
  However, Eevee is compatible with almost all Cycles nodes, so the addon can still be useful even if you render with Eevee
* To show previews for packed images, the .blend file has to be saved to disk first, because they are loaded through linking from the .blend file
* Thumbnails of image sequences are not updated when changing frames
* Open Shading Language script nodes are currently not supported
* IES nodes are currently not supported

# Installation

* On Windows, you have to install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017: https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
  (a newer version might be installed already, which is OK)
* The rest of the installation works the same as with any other addon: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/editors/preferences/addons.html#rd-party-add-ons
  (open user preferences, choose "install from file", select the downloaded .zip archive, click open, enable the addon in the list)

# Usage

Settings can be found in the user preferences by searching for "Node Preview" and clicking the arrow to the left of the addon entry

# Updating or Removing the Addon on Windows

# About Me

I am the author of the Blender addon for LuxCore, https://github.com/luxcorerender/blendluxcore
In 2014, I started working on Blender addons by contributing to the LuxRender addon.
NodePreview is my second commercial addon after ImageNodePreview: https://blendermarket.com/products/image-node-preview

# Changelog

v1.8:
* Added support for Python 3.10 on Windows and Linux

v1.7:
* Added support for the Apple Silicon (M1) version of Blender

v1.6:
* Fixed previews not working after opening a .blend file directly (by double-clicking it in the OS file explorer)
  (this was a regression introduced in v1.5)
* Fixed some shader node previews not working in Blender 3.0

v1.5:
* Fixed background process stopping when an image file did not exist at the specified path
* New packed images are now automatically loaded as soon as possible (when the .blend file is saved)
* Improved the error messages shown when an image file doesn't exist or could not be linked
* Fixed images not being reloaded if the path of an existing image datablock was modified
* If a packed file can't be linked, but exists on disk, it is now loaded from disk as fallback
* The debug log output can now be enabled in the user preferences (can be useful when making a bug report)
* Fixed old rendering jobs still being processed after loading a new .blend file (was a problem when opening a file with hundreds of nodes, then switching to another file before all thumbnails were rendered. Outdated jobs are now discarded)

v1.4:
* Added support for Blender 2.93
* Fixed fallback for unsupported image formats not working and returning a black image
* Fixed addon not working if an alternative scripts path was set, but the addon was installed in the default location

v1.3:
* Improved performance in complex node trees. In a scene with 295 nodes, the update checks took
  around 200 milliseconds before, which resulted in 5 frames per second in the node editor.
  Now, they only take around 40 milliseconds (25 frames per second)
* Fix UV Map output being black when using a UV map that doesn't exist on the preview mesh
* New shortcut: Ctrl+Shift+P toggles the node preview thumbnail of selected nodes on/off
* It is now possible to choose in the user preferences wether previews should be visible by default.
  You can set this to disabled if you only want a few nodes to show previews (use Ctrl+Shift+P to enable them)
* New controls in the N-Panel of the node editor (right side), with options to disable/enable
  previews for the whole node tree or selected nodes.

v1.2:
* Added support for macOS
* Fixed frames in node groups causing all thumbnails for the current node tree to disappear
* Fixed unsupported nodes causing all previews to disappear
* Added support for custom nodes which are internally node groups, e.g. FxNodes

v1.1:
* Enabled previews on the Geometry node
* Fixed addon not working if installed in an alternative scripts path (Preferences > File Paths > Data > Scripts)
* Users can now pick custom colors for the background which is shown behind transparent shaders
